Simple application built following The Ruby on Rails Tutorial - [Chapter 2](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app#code-toy_user_presence_valications)

## Main takeaways:
- Rails scaffolding automatically generates code that makes it relatively easy to create an application quickly
- Rails uses a Model-View-Controller structure to manage data
- Rails applications are built with a RESTful architecture. The REST actions are associated with HTTP routes.
